I was able to do everything that was asked for on this project except the media query. It wasnt in the criteria but since
we had a little idea of how to do it, I wanted to add that to my project.I need a little more research on it, to fully
understand it.

I had no help from anyone and did everything with the help of what we learned in class and internet search through 'w3chool'
for my 'css'.
I have referenced the sites I used and some sites are not referenced because I did not use anything but it did give me an
idea on how to do it.

For this assignment, I spent about 12 days to complete it. Some days i just did research on how it is done
without actually implementing it in my project yet.So the hours
