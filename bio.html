      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Alvin Teye currently studying at Northampton University.<br/>I moved
      to Milton Keynes after my studies in Belgium to study <br> computer science since all I have been doing since childhood is <br>
       breaking and fixing computers.<br/>I have a soft-spot for anything that has to do with computing.<br/> I studied
          Industrial Engineering and Industrial programming through <br> my time in Belgium and
          now, I have decided to embark on the journey <br>
           to become a professional 'coder'.Dont worry, I wont be hacking you.
